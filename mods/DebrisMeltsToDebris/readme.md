Elements which convert into other solids when heated will have its debris turn directly into the corresponding debris item, rather than convert from debris into a full tile.

This is to prevent sometimes-undesirable behavior of small items transforming into solid tiles when heated to their transition point, clogging automation and resulting in 50% mass loss when the tile is mined.

This includes algae, slime, and polluted dirt turning to dirt, dirt turning to sand, clay turning to ceramic, coal turning to refined coal, and any other solid-solid transitions.

Liquid and gas transitions are unaffected.

Items in storage bins get dropped onto the floor when they transition, I am not yet smart enough to figure out how to prevent this behavior, though maybe I will revisit later. However, bins no longer get entombed like in vanilla.

If you want to form natural tiles to allow Pips to plant wild plants, you may want to download a mod which allows you to build them directly. Alternatively, large volumes of magma will solidify into pip-plantable igneous rock tiles when cooled (small volumes of magma drop rock debris)

Not sure about DLC compatibility.
