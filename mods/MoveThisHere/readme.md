Move This Here is an quality-of-life item relocation utility which allows you to order selected resources in exact quantities - including liquids and gasses - moved to a specific location on the map, bottling from pumps if necessary.

The mod introduces a single building, the Hauling Point.
[list]
[*]Hauling Points are free and instantaneous to contruct anywhere, and require no research.
[*]Hauling Points can accept selected materials like a storage bin, except they can also accept liquids and gasses as well. 
[*]Selected materials will be brought to the Hauling Point by duplicants doing Storing chores.
[*]When enough materials are in the desired location, click "Remove" to instantly deconstruct the Hauling Point and drop the accumulated resources on the ground. You can also drag the deconstruct tool.
[*]The Hauling Point has an auto-bottle toggle, so liquids can be taken from hand pumps if desired.
[*]The Hauling Point can have its maximum capacity set, and as little as one gram can be relocated. This is impossible in the base game, but is extremely useful for liquid locks and other applicatons.
[*]The Hauling Point can be set to automatically remove itself and drop resources on reaching maximum capicity, allowing for hands-off relocation.
[*]The Hauling Point can be set drop liquids and gasses as bottles and canisters on removal, or spill them into the world.
[*]Materials can NOT be removed from the hauling point once they are stored within - the Hauling Point must be removed to reclaim resources. Hauling Points are intended for item relocation, not to replace storage lockers.
[/list]

The features of Hauling Points allow fine control over the items in your colony, for example:
[list]
[*]Moving specific amounts of liquid for liquid locks is simple, fast, and does not require bottle emptiers or mopping.
[*]Canisters of gas can be easily released in specific locations, such as a drecko farm, or chlorine in a slime-holding area. 
[*]Sweeping certain materials to nearby temporary locations, rather than far away storage bins.
[*]Ice relocation from cold biomes to areas needing cooling.
[*]Specific feed relocation to ranches in batches.
[*]Hauling Points can be built in midair and materials dropped into pits, or into magma for melting or disposal.

Known issue: At capacities less than 0.1kg, the UI may show a rounded number such as zero kg, however, the amount actually typed will still be delivered (eg, 0.013kg) This is a limitation of ONI's UI.

I hope you enjoy this mod! Please report any bugs, or suggestions to improve it!
