This mod makes solids that melt on the conveyor rail system no longer leave behind empty baskets. 

These empty conveyor baskets cannot be read by automation sensors, but will still occupy space in the network and can clog up automated rail systems that handle meltable objects.

Objects will still melt and sublime on the conveyor rails normally, the mod only changes the fact that the baskets they used to occupy will disappear allowing the baskets behind to continue moving forward.

This mod works very well with my other debris transition mod, Debris Melts to Debris. However, this mod must be first in the mod loading order (this mod above DMTD on the mods list on the main menu) With these two mods you will be able to create some very complex boiler, freezer, and forge designs and take advantage of the high mass and thermal throughput of solid rails.

Please report any bugs!
