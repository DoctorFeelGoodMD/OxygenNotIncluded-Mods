This mod allows populations of critters to be untamed.

The mechanism is simple: Tame critters, when starving, will lay wild eggs which will hatch into wild critters.

Tame critters themselves will not untame on their own, it is the next generation that will be untamed. I guess the title is kind of misleading, huh?

After some thought about the best way to implement untaming, this is what I settled on as the most balanced for normal gameplay. An 'untame' button would pretty easily negate most of intended challenges of keeping tame animals, and untaming stations or chores would have the same issues plus be hard to implement (though I do admit it would be fun to put critters in the skill scrubber)

Implications are:
- Tame critters released into the wilderness will eventually have their spawn revert to wild, assuming they can live long enough to lay an egg.
- Ranches left to starve will eventually have all their critters revert to wild. However, if critters lay eggs before they run out of stored calories, those eggs will still be tame.
- If ranches are kept groomed but not fed, wild critters will be automatically re-tamed by your duplicants, so it will have little impact on normal operations assuming this upkeep is done.
- Some critters like pacu will be hard to keep tame due to dietary demands. If you can't feed them, you will have to make do with keeping them as wild critters and taming them again when necessary for increased production or eggs.
- Greatly reduced animal cruelty.

Should work with base and DLC.
