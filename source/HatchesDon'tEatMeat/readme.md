This mod removes raw meat from the diet of hatches and their variants. 

This prevents the problem of hatches immediately eating the meat from other hatches who die or are killed in non-mechanized ranches. This is particularly intended for early game before auto-sweepers are available.

Affects only raw non-fish meat. They will still eat barbeque, if you really want to do that for some reason.
