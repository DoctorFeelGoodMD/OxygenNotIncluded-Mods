This mod removes water from the Tofu recipe. It now only requires 6 Nosh Beans.

Nosh Beans are almost never used because they are so difficult to grow. The requirement then for water to make Tofu is particularly ridiculous because it requires a pitcher pump to be used, which feels like a kitchen-design annoyance rather than a challenge. Compared to Sleet Wheat, which not only lacks this requirement to make bread but can make high-end products with only a single cooking step, beans and tofu products have almost no advantages.

This no-water recipe aims to bring Nosh Beans a little closer to the alternatives when considering a routine food supply.
