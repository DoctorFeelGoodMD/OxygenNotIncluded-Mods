This mod allows tame critters to become wild again (sort of)

The mechanism is simple: starving critters lay wild eggs, which hatch into wild critters.

I guess it's kind of a misleading title, huh? You don't untame the critter but you can untame the ranch.

After some thought about what may be the best way to implement untaming critters without upsetting game balance, this is what I settled on. An 'untame' button would be pretty easy to abuse to keep your ranches alive forever with no inputs or labor, and untaming stations or tasks would have the same issue and be difficult to implement (as fun as it would be to put critters into the skill scrubber) You can already spawn wild critters in sandbox mode so this is intended for normal gameplay.

Implications are:
- Critters turned loose from your ranch to the wildnerness will have their spawn revert to wild, assuming they have enough lifespan to lay an egg.
- Ranches left to starve will eventually have their population revert to wild, though eggs laid before the critters begin to starve will still be tame.
- If critters are being groomed, they will be automatically re-tamed, so it will have little effect on your overall operation assuming your ranch gets any attention at all.
- Pacu will be hard to keep tame given their inputs, though wild pacu are still quite productive. Taming will be really only useful to increase the population.

Should be compatible with DLC. Please post any bugs, or ideas for how to better implement untaming.

Someday, I'll pick up the steam version on sale and put this on the workship.
